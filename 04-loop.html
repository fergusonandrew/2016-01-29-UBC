<blockquote><h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.</li>
<li>Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Loops</strong> are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute
commands repetitively. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing (and typing mistakes).
Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named <code>basilisk.dat</code>, <code>unicorn.dat</code>, and so on.
In this example,
we'll use the <code>creatures</code> directory which only has two example files,
but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.
We would like to modify these files, but also save a version of the original files, naming the copies
<code>original-basilisk.dat</code> and <code>original-unicorn.dat</code>.</p>

<p>Although you might think that we can, based on what we've learned already, we can't just type something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp *.dat original-*.dat
</code></pre>

<p>because here's what it actually expands to:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp basilisk.dat unicorn.dat original-*.dat
</code></pre>

<p>This wouldn't back up our files, instead we get a usage error:</p>

<pre><code>cp: target `original-*.dat' is not a directory
</code></pre>

<p>This a problem arises when <code>cp</code> receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it
expects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.
Since there is no directory named <code>original-*.dat</code> in the <code>creatures</code> directory we get an
error.</p>

<p>Instead, we can use a <strong>loop</strong>
to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
Here's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:</p>

<pre><code>$ for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
&gt; do
&gt;    head -3 $filename
&gt; done
</code></pre>

<pre><code>COMMON NAME: basilisk
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
UPDATED: 1745-05-02
COMMON NAME: unicorn
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
UPDATED: 1738-11-24
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'll explain what just happened: When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>,
it knows it is supposed to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing in a list.
In this case, the list is the two filenames.
Each time through the loop,
the name of the thing currently being operated on is assigned to
the <strong>variable</strong> called <code>filename</code>.
Inside the loop, we get the variable's value by putting <code>$</code> in front of it:
<code>$filename</code> is <code>basilisk.dat</code> the first time through the loop, <code>unicorn.dat</code> the second, and so on. These values get fed to the function we are calling, in this case, 'head'.</p>

<p>By using the dollar sign we are telling the shell interpreter to treat
<code>filename</code> as a variable name and substitute its value, not as some text or external command.</p>

<blockquote><h2>Follow the Prompt</h2>

<p>Another thing to note is that the shell prompt changed from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and back again as we were
typing in our loop. The second prompt, <code>&gt;</code>, is different to remind
us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet. Also, rather than typing each command out on a spearate line, you can use a semicolon, <code>;</code>,
to separate commands written on a single line.</p></blockquote>

<p>We called our variable in this loop <code>filename</code>
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:</p>

<pre><code>for x in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $x
done
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>for temperature in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $temperature
done
</code></pre>

<p>it would work exactly the same way.
BUT, <em>don't do this.</em>
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names (like <code>x</code>) or misleading names (like <code>temperature</code>)
increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.</p>

<p>Here's a slightly more complicated loop we can execute together:</p>

<pre><code>for filename in *.dat
do
    echo $filename
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done
</code></pre>

<p>The shell starts by expanding <code>*.dat</code> to create the list of files it will process.
The <strong>loop body</strong>
then executes two commands for each of those files.
The first command, <code>echo</code>, just prints its command-line parameters to standard output.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo hello world
</code></pre>

<p>prints:</p>

<pre><code>hello world
</code></pre>

<p>In this case,
since the shell expands <code>$filename</code> to be the name of a file,
<code>echo $filename</code> just prints the name of the file.
Note that we can't execute this loop without <code>echo</code> because then the first time through the loop, the shell would try to run <code>basilisk.dat</code> as a program.
And lastly, the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> combination selects lines 81-100 from whatever file is being processed.</p>

<blockquote><h2>Spaces in Names</h2>

<p>Filename expansion in loops is another reason you should not use spaces in filenames.
Suppose our data files are named so that creatures with multi-word names have spaces:</p>

<pre><code>basilisk.dat
red dragon.dat
unicorn.dat
</code></pre>

<p>If we try to process them using the same loop we just used then the shell will expand <code>*.dat</code> to create four values for $filename:</p>

<pre><code>basilisk.dat
red
dragon.dat
unicorn.dat
</code></pre>

<p>That's a problem: <code>head</code> can't read files called <code>red</code> and <code>dragon.dat</code>
because they don't exist,
and won't be asked to read the file <code>red dragon.dat</code>.</p>

<p>We can make our script a little bit more robust
by <strong>quoting</strong> our use of the variable:</p>

<pre><code>for filename in *.dat
do
    head -100 "$filename" | tail -20
done
</code></pre>

<p>but it's simpler just to avoid using spaces (or other special characters) in filenames.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, now we can come back around to our original file copying problem,
and solve it using this loop:</p>

<pre><code>for filename in *.dat
do
    cp $filename original-$filename
done
</code></pre>

<p>This loop runs the <code>cp</code> command once for each filename.
The first time, the shell executes:</p>

<pre><code>cp basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
</code></pre>

<p>The second time, the command is:</p>

<pre><code>cp unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</code></pre>

<blockquote><h2>Measure Twice, Run Once</h2>

<p>A loop is a way to do many things at once --- or to make many mistakes at
once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop <em>would</em> do
is to echo the commands it would run instead of actually running them.
For example, we could write our file copying loop like this:</p>

<pre><code>for filename in *.dat
do
    echo cp $filename original-$filename
done
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of running <code>cp</code>, this loop runs <code>echo</code>, which prints out:</p>

<pre><code>cp basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
cp unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</code></pre>

<p><em>without</em> actually running those commands. We can then use up-arrow to
redisplay the loop, back-arrow to get to the word <code>echo</code>, delete it, and
then press "enter" to run the loop with the actual <code>cp</code> commands. This
isn't foolproof, but it's a handy way to see what's going to happen when
you're still learning how loops work.</p></blockquote>

<p>CHECK THE TIME, DO YOU HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THE 'Beginning and End', and 'History...' sections?</p>

<h2>Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files</h2>

<p>There is a whole section here where we repeat what we just learned using Nelle's files, and the programs that her supervisor and colleagues wrote. Since those programs don't actually exist, and we already covered the concepts that are used, I'm going to skip it. There are a couple handy new tricks to introduce here at the end though, if I have time.</p>

<blockquote><h2>Beginning and End</h2>

<p>We can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing <code>^A</code>
(which means Control-A)
and to the end using <code>^E</code>.</p>

<h2>Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It</h2>

<p>Another way to repeat previous work is to use the <code>history</code> command to
get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and
then to use <code>!123</code> (where "123" is replaced by the command number) to
repeat one of those commands. For example, if Nelle types this:</p>

<pre><code>$ history | tail -5
  456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt
  458  bash goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
  459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  460  history
</code></pre>

<p>then she can re-run <code>goostats</code> on <code>NENE01729B.txt</code> simply by typing
<code>!458</code>.</p>

<h2>Variables in Loops {.challenge}</h2>

<p>Suppose that <code>ls</code> initially displays:</p>

<pre><code>fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat
</code></pre>

<p>What is the output of:</p>

<pre><code>for datafile in *.dat
do
    ls *.dat
done
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what is the output of:</p>

<pre><code>for datafile in *.dat
do
  ls $datafile
done
</code></pre>

<p>Why do these two loops give you different outputs?</p>

<h2>Saving to a File in a Loop - Part One {.challenge}</h2>

<p>In the same directory, what is the effect of this loop?</p>

<pre><code>for sugar in *.dat
do
    echo $sugar
    cat $sugar &gt; xylose.dat
done
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Prints <code>fructose.dat</code>, <code>glucose.dat</code>, and <code>sucrose.dat</code>, and the text from <code>sucrose.dat</code> will be saved to a file called <code>xylose.dat</code>.</li>
<li>Prints <code>fructose.dat</code>, <code>glucose.dat</code>, and <code>sucrose.dat</code>, and the text from all three files would be
concatenated and saved to a file called <code>xylose.dat</code>.</li>
<li>Prints <code>fructose.dat</code>, <code>glucose.dat</code>, <code>sucrose.dat</code>, and
<code>xylose.dat</code>, and the text from <code>sucrose.dat</code> will be saved to a file called <code>xylose.dat</code>.</li>
<li>None of the above.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Saving to a File in a Loop - Part Two {.challenge}</h2>

<p>In another directory, where <code>ls</code> returns:</p>

<pre><code>fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat   maltose.txt
</code></pre>

<p>What would be the output of the following loop?</p>

<pre><code>for datafile in *.dat
do
    cat $datafile &gt;&gt; sugar.dat
done
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>All of the text from <code>fructose.dat</code>, <code>glucose.dat</code> and <code>sucrose.dat</code> would be
concatenated and saved to a file called <code>sugar.dat</code>.</li>
<li>The text from <code>sucrose.dat</code> will be saved to a file called <code>sugar.dat</code>.</li>
<li>All of the text from <code>fructose.dat</code>, <code>glucose.dat</code>, <code>sucrose.dat</code> and <code>maltose.txt</code>
would be concatenated and saved to a file called <code>sugar.dat</code>.</li>
<li>All of the text from <code>fructose.dat</code>, <code>glucose.dat</code> and <code>sucrose.dat</code> would be printed
to the screen and saved to a file called <code>sugar.dat</code></li>
</ol>


<h2>Doing a Dry Run {.challenge}</h2>

<p>Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute
without actually running those commands:</p>

<pre><code>for file in *.dat
do
  analyze $file &gt; analyzed-$file
done
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between the two loops below, and which one would we
want to run?</p>

<pre><code># Version 1
for file in *.dat
do
  echo analyze $file &gt; analyzed-$file
done
</code></pre>

<pre><code># Version 2
for file in *.dat
do
  echo "analyze $file &gt; analyzed-$file"
done
</code></pre>

<h2>Nested Loops and Command-Line Expressions {.challenge}</h2>

<p>The <code>expr</code> does simple arithmetic using command-line parameters:</p>

<pre><code>$ expr 3 + 5
8
$ expr 30 / 5 - 2
4
</code></pre>

<p>Given this, what is the output of:</p>

<pre><code>for left in 2 3
do
    for right in $left
    do
        expr $left + $right
    done
done
</code></pre></blockquote>
