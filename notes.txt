####INTRO####
1. don't use a mirrored display, use an extended display. keep your notes on one screen and the what the students are going to see on the other.

2. get the students to open a terminal window. make sure they have unzipped the tutorial file onto their desktop

3. No Nelle Nemo intro. Just tell the students we are working with Nelle Nemo's data. She's a marine biologist. That's all you need to know.
